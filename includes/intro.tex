\section{The context}

Extract from article ``The Really Smart Phone'' in the Wall Street journal (April 22, 2011)~\cite{really-smart-phone}.

\begin{quotation}
  As a tool for field research, the cellphone is unique. Unlike a
  conventional land-line telephone, a mobile phone usually is used by
  only one person, and it stays with that person everywhere,
  throughout the day.
  [...]\\

  Advances in statistics, psychology and the
  science of social networks are giving researchers the tools to find
  patterns of human dynamics too subtle to detect by other means. At
  Northeastern University in Boston, network physicists discovered
  just how predictable people could be by studying the travel routines
  of 100,000 European mobile-phone users.
  [...]\\

  After analyzing more than
  16 million records of call date, time and position, the researchers
  determined that, taken together, people's movements appeared to
  follow a mathematical pattern. The scientists said that, with enough
  information about past movements, they could forecast someone's
  future whereabouts with 93.6\% accuracy.
  The pattern held true whether people stayed close to home or
  traveled widely, and wasn't affected by the phone user's age or
  gender.\\

We introduce the context of the current thesis with this extract of an article published in 2011 in the Wall Street Journal.
This gives a reality view on the potential from the exploitation of the massive amount of data generated by our smart phones.
One year later one can only confirm this structural trend.\\

The usage of technology is more and more embedded in our everyday life.
It keeps us organised and our ubiquitous interactions with others in a way that is less and less conscious.
Even more we get so used to the convenience of those technologies that we might get less and less reluctant at unveiling a part of our private life.
This is clearly a new way of life.\\

This thesis does not focus on computers or websites on the Internet but on the devices implementing this technology that contributes to our new way of life.
%These devices work as a black-box, if they \emph{just work} is usually enough for the usage we have of it.
Those devices are designed and marketed more as easy-to-use appliances than as computers with their complexity and known vulnerabilities.
Actually a modern smartphone is definitely not an appliance but a general purpose computer fitting in a very small and convenient case.
It is very convenient but this convenience often has a price, one is privacy.\\

The privacy aspect of appliances is usually ignored, considered as \emph{good enough}.
The confidence in the manufacturer's importance to protect is also a recurrent problem in the privacy scandals.\\


\section{Case study choices}

As part of this thesis, it has been decided to focus on two types of devices: smartphones (running Android) and wireless cameras.
This choice is justified as the privacy importance of these two devices.\\

The smartphones penetration rate is in constant raise and, in a few years, it is expected that the large majority of persons own such device in our countries.
Similarly to our personal computers, these devices contains more and more personal data.
The consequences of compromising these data can be very high for an end-user.\\

The wireless camera market is not as developed as for the smartphones but the privacy threat is as important.
The consequences of camera compromising and unauthorised access to the video stream is potentially very high and can have the opposite effect than the one expected (to facilitate abuses instead of protecting).\\

For each topic, a particular case study, the Android system and the D-Link DCS-2130 camera, has been selected.
Both case studies choices are considered as relevant and representative for the general device type.
These two choices are justified in the related parts.


\section{Thesis organisation}

The thesis is divided into two distinct parts.
The content of each part is independent and the order of reading does not affect the general comprehension.\\

\textbf{Part \ref{part:android}} is about the Android system and is composed of four chapters.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:andro-intro}} presents and justifies the choice of studying the Android system as well as the focus on the localisation.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:and-loc}} explains the localisation techniques used in Android as well as the privacy aspect related to it.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:and-secu}} presents the current security mechanisms used in the Android system to avoid abuses from the applications and how the current security weaknesses are exploited by malicious developers.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:droidwatcher}} is a presentation of the developed software \emph{DroidWatcher} as an application of the concepts introduced in the two previous chapters.\\

\textbf{Part \ref{part:camera}} is about wireless cameras and is composed of two chapters.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:wifi-cam}} is an introduction to wireless cameras.
It presents the different types of cameras and the risks of discovery and compromising of a web digital camera.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:cam-dcs}} is a full security analysis of the chosen camera model D-Link DCS-2130.\\

The appendix contains documents related to mentioned as well as every software developed in the context of this thesis.
