\section{The context}

The usage of technology is essential in our everyday life nowadays.
It keeps us organised and manage our communications in a way we do not even realise it anymore.
This thesis does not focus on computers or websites of the internet but on embedded devices used in everyday life.
These devices works as a black-box, if they \emph{just work} is usually enough for the usage we have of it.
It is very convenient but this convenience has often a price, one is privacy.\\

The privacy aspect of an embedded device is usually ignored, considered as \emph{good enough}.
The confidence in the manufacturer's importance to protect is also a reccurent problem in the privacy scandals.\\



\section{Case study choices}

As part of this thesis, it has been decided to focus on two types of devices: smartphones (running Android) and wireless cameras.
This choice is justified as the privacy importance of these two devices.\\

The smartphones penetration rate is in constant raise and, in a few years, it is expected that the large majority of person own such device in our countries.
Similarly to our personal computers, these devices contains more and more personal data.
The consequences of compromising these data can be very high for an end-user.\\

The wireless camera market is not as developed as for the smartphones but the privacy threat is as important.
The consequences of camera compromising and unauthorised access to the video stream is potentially very high and can have the opposite effect than the one expected (facilitate abuses instead of protecting).\\

For both devices, a particular case study, the Android system and the D-Link DCS-2130 camera, have been selected.
Both case studies choices are believed as relevant and representative for the general device type.
These two choices are justified in the related parts.


\section{Thesis organisation}

The thesis is divided in two distinct parts.
The content of each part is independent and the order of reading does not affect the general comprehension.\\

\textbf{Part \ref{part:android}} is about the Android system and is composed of three chapters.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:andro-intro}} presents and justifies the choice of studying the Android system as well as the focus on the localisation.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:and-loc}} explains the localisation techniques used in Android as well as the privacy aspect related to it.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:droidwatcher}} is a presentation of the developed software \emph{DroidWatcher} as an application of the concepts introduced in the two previous chapters.\\

\textbf{Part \ref{part:camera}} is about wireless cameras and is composed of two chapters.\\

\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:wifi-cam}} is an introduction to wireless cameras.
It presents the different types of camera and the risks of discovery and compromising of a web digital camera.
\textbf{Chapter \ref{chap:cam-dcs}} is a full security analysis of the chosen camera model D-Link DCS-2130.
